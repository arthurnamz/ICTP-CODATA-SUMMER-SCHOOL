Open data in a big data world: https://council.science/publications/open-data-in-a-big-data-world/

Questions:
1. Is open data better than FAIR data?
All data should be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), but not all data needs to be open. For example, data from sick children can not be made available (due to ethical reasons), but the data can be findable and stored in a secure repository. You can negotiate with the ethics committee if you want to see the data. Make sure there is appropriate metadata so that the data can be reusable.

2. Many people say that Open Science and patents are not compatible. What is your comment about this?
Traditional understanding about patenting - not sharing the data. However, if you make data open (even just a little), people can spot errors in the data and it's beneficial to the business model. Rethink the way that the community can be of help instead of viewing them as the enemy. Thank you! RZP

Self-help procedure to access an ICTP online Linux desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps [ONLY FOR the ONLINE PARTICIPANTS]:
1. Open a terminal and run the following code (make sure to use your own ICTP email address where it says "your-email-address" in the code below):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C your-email-address -f SMR3685
2. For the question about passphrase, you can just press the Enter key twice or set a passphrase of your choice.
3. A file named SMR3685.pub will be saved in the current working directory (if you are not sure where this is, type pwd and press Enter/Return).
4.  Upload the SMR3685.pub file using the URL specified in the manual sent to you.  NOTE: click on the "Select or drop files" button and browse to the folder/locaton where you created the SSH key (step 2).
5. Wait 5 minutes and login to your email, you should see an email about smr3685 online Linux desktop. Follow the steps provided in the email. You should now see the Desktop Environment in your browser.
6. From now on, you can either login by repeating step 5, or you can you can also access the Linux desktop from the terminal by using the ssh command from the command prompt or terminal as described in the email you received.  NOTE: If you set up a passphrase (during step 2), you will be asked to enter your passphrase to unlock the key.
[THE ABOVE SELF-HELP PROCEDURE WORKS ONLY FOR  Windows 10 or 11; MacOS or Linux]. Please let us know if you have a different Operating System where an OpenSSH client is not available]

- FAIRAware is a nice FAIR data self-assessment tool created by DANS and partners.  https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/ 
- pre-print repositories are a great way to ensure that your research is visible and citable while your papers are currently in press in a journal, The ArXiv network of pre-print repositories are a good example.
