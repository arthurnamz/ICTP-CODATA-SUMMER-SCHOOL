# The CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School
This activity focuses on building a range of data-related skills that are vital for addressing trans-disciplinary challenges in contemporary research work.

# Description
The Summer School builds competence in data analysis and security for participants from all disciplines and/ or backgrounds from sciences to humanities. Topics to be covered include
principles and practice of research data management, authorship in the 21st century, data curation, data security, Open Science, visualization, machine learning and artificial
neural networks.

The activity includes practical hands-on sessions on techniques and applications for largescale data handling, analysis, visualization and modeling on a variety of compute infrastructure
including high performance compute platforms/systems. An associated activity focusing on advanced aspects of Data Science will run immediately after this event and requires a separate application.
